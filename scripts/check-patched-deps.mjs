/**
 * check-patched-deps — verify that pnpm's patchedDependencies were actually
 * applied, and heal caches that still carry pre-patch code.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: pnpm names each patched package's directory in
 * node_modules/.pnpm with the patch content hash (…_patch_hash=<hash>) and
 * trusts that name on later installs. If the materialization that first
 * produced the directory was corrupted (interrupted install, a store shared
 * across filesystems/pnpm versions), the directory keeps the CORRECT hash in
 * its name but UNPATCHED content — and every subsequent `pnpm install` reuses
 * it silently, forever. The failure mode downstream is maddening: our CSS/JS
 * written against the patched behavior is correct, yet the app behaves as if
 * the patch never existed (seen in production dev-env: the dock tab-strip "+"
 * pinned to the far right because the patched DOM restructure was missing).
 *
 * TWO CHECKS, ONE SCRIPT:
 *
 * 1. VERIFY (fail loud): for every entry in pnpm-workspace.yaml
 *    patchedDependencies, parse the .patch file and assert each patched
 *    file's most distinctive ADDED line is present in the installed copy
 *    under node_modules/.pnpm/<pkg>_patch_hash=<any>/node_modules/<pkg>/.
 *    Content is the ground truth; the directory name is not trusted.
 *
 * 2. SWEEP (self-heal): Vite's dep-optimizer cache key is the LOCKFILE,
 *    which a cache-poisoning incident does not change — so a bundle built
 *    from a poisoned install keeps being served even after node_modules is
 *    fixed. For each patch, take its most distinctive REMOVED line (code
 *    that must no longer exist anywhere post-patch) and scan the optimizer
 *    caches; a hit means the cache was built from unpatched code, so the
 *    whole cache dir is deleted (vite just re-optimizes on next start).
 *    Matching is whitespace-insensitive because esbuild reprints code; dev
 *    prebundles are not minified, so identifier/property text survives.
 *
 * ENTRY POINTS — both must stay wired or a poisoned state can slip through:
 *  - root `postinstall`: catches poisoned installs at install time (also
 *    covers the production web image build, which COPYs this script).
 *  - apps/web vite plugin (configResolved): catches the pull-without-install
 *    path — the lockfile rarely changes, so a colleague may never trigger an
 *    install, but every dev/build run starts vite.
 *
 * Dependency-free by design: it runs as postinstall, i.e. it cannot rely on
 * the very node_modules it validates (hence the YAML line-scanner too).
