-- name: AdmitSessionRun :one
-- Durable admission. There is no queue: SR-OWN-001 permits answering busy, so a
-- second concurrent invocation is rejected rather than parked.
--
-- Busy is rejected in two layers. The adapter's indexed pre-read catches the
-- common case before this statement runs at all, so contended submissions never
-- reach the write path. This statement handles only what slipped through that
-- unlocked read: session_runs_single_active raises, and because the statement is
-- one implicit transaction the rollback takes the allocated turn position with
-- it, leaving nothing behind for the caller to clean up.
--
-- Returns no rows when this invocation_id was already admitted — ON CONFLICT
-- keeps the ordinary retry path free of errors, which matters because channel
-- redelivery makes it a routine event — or when the session does not exist. The
-- caller re-selects by invocation to tell those two apart.
--
-- A position is allocated only for an admission that can still succeed: never
-- for a known duplicate (the NOT EXISTS guard below) and never for a rejected
-- one (the rollback). The single exception is two callers racing on the *same*
-- invocation_id, where both pass the guard against the statement snapshot and
-- the loser's increment commits with no row. That leaves a gap in turn_position,
-- which is ordering-only and never read as a count.
