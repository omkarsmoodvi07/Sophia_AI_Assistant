                   steps aside instead of stacking a second sidebar beside it.
                   The sidebar is h-dvh, so its right border now runs unbroken from
                   the very top — there's no full-width topbar cutting across it.
                   The macOS traffic lights are cleared by the sidebar's own top
                   drag row (mac-traffic-reserve), mirroring the chat SideBar. -->

                     it shares --background with the content below. Skipped for bot
                     detail: that route renders its OWN full-height sidebar inside
                     #main (MasterDetailSidebarLayout), so a strip here would sit
                     ON TOP of it and push its divider down — bot detail handles its
