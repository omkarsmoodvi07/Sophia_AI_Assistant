// composables/useViewSwap.ts — that composable is router-bound and stays in

// that container is an ANCESTOR outside this component entirely (settings
// pages scroll their shared `<section overflow-y-auto>`; a bot's detail tabs
// scroll their own `overflow-y-auto` pane). Swapping the slot content does
// nothing to that ancestor's scrollTop, so a detail view opened while the
// list was scrolled down used to inherit the list's scroll offset outright —
// the detail's own back button could land off-screen above the fold. This
// component owns the fix centrally (not each SwapTransition caller) so every
// current and future list<->detail pair gets correct scroll behavior for
// free just by using SwapTransition.
//
// Behavior: forward always opens the next pane at the top (a fresh surface
// shouldn't inherit a scroll offset that has nothing to do with it); back
// restores the exact offset the list/parent view had before the user drilled
// in (iOS-style: pushing a screen remembers where you were, popping returns
// you there). A plain stack (not a single saved value) makes this correct
// for ANY nesting depth without special-casing.

       in style.css) so it doesn't shove the entering pane around. No `appear`:
       the first paint (landing from the sidebar) is a plain cut — only the
       swap moves. -->
