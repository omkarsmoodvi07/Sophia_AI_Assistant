// Sophia's stream doesn't carry reasoning duration, and a finished turn is
// re-fetched (which replaces the live components that measured it). To keep
// "Thought for Ns" after that refetch, the duration is measured live while
// streaming and stashed here keyed by the reasoning text; the re-mounted (done)
// block then recovers it by the same key. Cross-reload it's gone (no backend
// timing) — that's acceptable: the turn you just watched keeps its timer.
//
// Measurement is driven centrally from message-item so it covers *every*
// reasoning block, not only the last (tail) one: `markReasoningSeen` stamps a
// start the first time a block appears mid-stream, and `finalizeReasoning`
// closes it out once a later block appears or the turn ends. This is why a
// reasoning step that's immediately followed by a tool call still gets a real
// "Thought for Ns" instead of a bare "Thought".
