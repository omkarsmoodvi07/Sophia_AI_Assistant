/**
 * Back affordances need to know the *previous* in-app page to (a) decide whether
 * "back" should pop history or fall back to a fixed page, and (b) label itself
 * after where it actually leads.
 *
 * We cannot read this from history state. The web build uses createWebHistory
 * (window.history.state.back), but the desktop shell mounts the very same pages
 * under createMemoryHistory, whose stack lives in a private closure and is never
 * mirrored to window.history nor to router.options.history.state. So any
 * history-state read looks "cold" on desktop and wrongly falls back — which is
 * exactly why the bot back button kept reading "Bots" there.
 *
 * The one signal both backends share is router.afterEach. installBackHistory
 * tracks a small per-router stack from it, giving a backend-agnostic notion of
 * "the page before this one". router.back() itself works on both backends.
 *
 * In-page state (tabs/filters) writes itself into the URL — see useSyncedQueryParam.
 * Those transitions keep the same path, and installBackHistory treats a same-path
 * transition as "not a navigation": it skips updating the predecessor instead of
 * trusting callers to use replace. The contract is enforced here, not assumed, so a
 * tab swap can never make "back" point at (or label itself after) the current page.
