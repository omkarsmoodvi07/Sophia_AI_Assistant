 * useChatScroll — every scroll behavior for the chat message list.
 *
 * ─── What it does ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   • pin a just-sent prompt near the viewport top and let the reply stream
 *     into reserved blank below (send = "turn the page")
 *   • stick-to-bottom follow while a reply streams in — but only after the
 *     user opts in by scrolling to the bottom; pin and follow never overlap
 *   • let the user scroll away ("escape") and STAY there
 *   • jump-to-message + transient highlight (reply refs, the scroll rail)
 *   • keep the viewport still while older history is prepended at the top
 *   • restore scroll position across KeepAlive tab switches; a freshly
 *     opened session lands at the bottom (entry pin was a feature cut)
 *
 * ─── The one idea the whole file rests on ─────────────────────────────────
 * Follow and escape pull the scroll position in opposite directions, so
 * everything hinges on telling *the code's own scrolling* apart from *the
 * user's*. They are indistinguishable at the `scroll`-event layer — both just
 * fire `scroll`. The naive design (which this file was rewritten to kill) reads
 * `scroll` direction to decide "did the user leave?" while also snapping to the
 * bottom on every content growth; the follow's own scroll events then read as
 * user activity, the two fight every frame, and the user physically cannot
 * scroll away from a streaming reply.
 *
 * The fix is two independent guards:
 *   1. `isProgrammaticScroll` brackets every scroll the code performs; the
 *      `scroll` handler ignores events while it is set, so a follow scroll is
 *      never misread as the user leaving.
 *   2. Escape is latched only while a physical wheel, touch, pointer, or
 *      keyboard gesture surrounds the resulting `scrollTop` delta.
 *
 * ─── State model ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The hot-path latches are plain closure vars, NOT refs on purpose: they move
 * on every frame of a scroll and must never trigger a re-render. Exactly ONE
 * reactive mirror, `isAtBottom`, is exposed to the UI (the jump-to-bottom
 * button); update it wherever scrollTop changes, never read the latches from a
 * template.
 *
 *   isProgrammaticScroll  code is mid-scroll → treat scroll events as "ours"
 *   followEnabled         content growth may pull the viewport to the bottom;
 *                         false = parked (user escaped, or a turn is pinned)
 *   pinPending/pinAnchorId one-shot pin, applied when the target prompt renders
 *   pinScrollActive       pin's entrance tween in flight → freeze isAtBottom
 *   lastScrollTop         previous frame's scrollTop, for the up/down test
 *   lockScroll (ref)      init / cross-tab restore running → freeze BOTH follow
 *                         and escape so their setup scrolls latch nothing
 *
 * ─── Event flow ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   MutationObserver(content subtree) ─ streaming mutates the DOM ─▶ apply an
 *       armed pin (once, when the fresh prompt is in the DOM), then follow to
 *       the bottom IF followEnabled.
 *   ResizeObserver(content element) ─ image/font/layout-only reflow ─▶ run the
 *       same gated heartbeat. It never writes scrollTop merely because height
 *       changed: parked views stay parked, while an explicitly-following view
 *       is healed to the new bottom.
 *   wheel  ─▶ physical intent; deltaY<0 (up) parks the view immediately.
 *   scroll ─▶ refresh isAtBottom; if it is not our own scroll, run the latch.
 *
 * ─── Follow on / off ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Pin and follow are mutually exclusive phases, switched only by explicit
 * actions:
 *   • user scrolls down to the bottom                    → follow ON
 *     (parked at the pin already IS the bottom; arming there is a no-op
 *     until the reply outgrows the reserve)
 *   • jump-to-bottom button / session switch             → follow ON
 *   • any upward wheel / scroll                          → follow OFF
 *   • jump-to-message / rail / prepend (markEscaped)     → follow OFF
 *   • send (pinAfterSend)                                → follow OFF (parked)
 * There is deliberately NO "relock shortly after a downward pause" timer: it
 * would re-arm follow on any small downward nudge while a turn is parked, and
 * the next streamed token would yank the parked view to the bottom.
 *
 * ─── Prepend (older history) ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Loading older messages is treated as an escape (suppressAutoScrollForPrepend
 * → markEscaped): follow stays off, and the browser's native `overflow-anchor`
 * keeps the visible content stationary across the insert. There is NO manual
 * scrollTop compensation — and you must NOT set `overflow-anchor: none` on the
 * viewport. That was tried (to protect a browser-native smooth entrance
 * scroll, which anchoring can cancel) and it broke two things at once: each
 * prepend batch twitched, and the pin drifted off its offset — a
 * one-shot manual compensation / one-shot landing cannot track the ASYNC
 * layout settles (code highlighting, images, fonts) that keep resizing rows
 * after the DOM lands. Native anchoring corrects continuously; the pin's JS
 * tween is immune to it (it rewrites scrollTop every frame), so they coexist.
 *
 * ─── Browser vs hand-written scroll (read before changing pin/reserve) ───
 * We do NOT replace the browser's scroller. Most of the time the browser
 * owns scrollTop:
 *   • everyday wheel/touch scrolling
 *   • native overflow-anchor during history prepend and async reflow
 *     (Shiki / KaTeX / images / fonts) — see Prepend above
 *   • clamp when content shrinks past the max scroll
 *
 * What the browser does NOT know is chat product geometry:
 *   • residual pin blank is deliberate "reply room", not ordinary content
 *   • send = pin the new prompt at PIN_TOP_OFFSET_PX with previous-turn peek
 *   • that blank SURVIVES stream completion and stays until the next
 *     send's handover (legal layout — never trimmed while the view lives)
 *   • entrance needs a quintic ease-out tween, not native smooth
 *
 * So we hand-write scrollTop only on a NARROW boundary: the frame that
 * hands a pin from one turn to the next, plus the entrance tween itself.
 * That is intentional policy, not a temporary hack — but the surface must
 * stay narrow. If a new height-change path (Thought expand, tool group,
 * split pane, tab restore, …) seems to need the same compensation, do NOT
 * call collapseReserveKeepingView from there and do NOT add a second
 * settle-time / delayed "restore" layer. Either the product geometry
 * changed (rethink reserve structure) or the bug is elsewhere (follow
 * arming, remount, id identity). Three rewrite rounds died on "mechanism
 * got clever"; the surviving rule is: one named handover, one formula,
 * everything else stays dumb and browser-owned.
 *
 * ─── Pin (send only) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * On send (chat-pane → pinAfterSend) the newest prompt is pinned near the top
 * and the reply streams into reserved blank below. Mechanism: chat-pane
 * renders every turn in its own PERSISTENT container (keyed by the turn's
 * opening message — a send appends a container, it never re-parents previous
 * turns' DOM; re-parenting remounts the subtree and its transient height
 * collapse read as a scroll jump).
 *
 * tryApplyPin order is load-bearing (single coordinate system):
 *   1. Retire the PREVIOUS turn's residual blank via
 *      collapseReserveKeepingView (position-aware — see that function).
 *   2. Measure and set the NEW turn's min-height once.
 *   3. Tween to prompt top − PIN_TOP_OFFSET_PX.
 *
 * Two rejected alternatives (do not resurrect without a new product reason):
 *   A. Keep old blank for the whole flight, clear at settle.
 *      Document is [prev content | EMPTY SPACING | new prompt | new blank].
 *      The tween pins the new prompt by scrolling through that empty band,
 *      so the previous turn leaves the viewport and looks unmounted; settle
 *      then removes the spacing and the previous turn "reappears". User-
 *      confirmed wrong.
 *   B. Clear old blank before the tween with flat `scrollTop -= fullDelta`.
 *      Keeps content BELOW the blank fixed — but when the user is parked on
 *      the previous pin (reading content ABOVE the blank) or reading history
 *      far above, that yanks the whole view before the entrance starts.
 *      User-confirmed wrong.
 *
 * Position-aware collapse (A/B midpoint) only compensates the removed band
 * that sat above the viewport top. Parked on previous-turn content, the
 * blank is below the viewport top → scrollTop stays put → blank vanishes →
 * the down animation then carries REAL previous-turn content into the peek.
 * From there CSS layout does everything: the reply consumes the new reserve,
 * tool/Thought toggles use more or less of it, content past min-height makes
 * it inert. The reserve is LEGAL LAYOUT for the rest of this view's life —
 * NEVER recomputed, never trimmed on completion or scroll (Grok-parity
 * rule: spacing must not jump). It dies only at the next send's handover,
 * a session switch, or the view unmounting (KeepAlive tab switches keep
 * the DOM, so they keep the spacing). While pinned, follow is OFF; it re-arms on
 * any downward scroll at the bottom, which parked-at-pin trivially is —
 * harmless, since follow-to-scrollHeight is a no-op there.
 *
 * Opening a session does NOT pin — it lands at the bottom via the follow
 * heartbeat (entry pin was a deliberate feature cut; see the sessionId
 * watch). Only sending pins.
 *
 * ─── chat-pane contract ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * chat-pane owns the DOM refs and drives this composable through:
 *   scrollToBottom (jump button) · scrollToMessage (reply refs) · pinAfterSend
 *   (on send) · suppressAutoScrollForPrepend (top sentinel) · markEscaped +
 *   startScrollTween + findMessageElement + getElementAbsoluteTop (scroll rail)
 *   · onMessageActive (per message-item) · onActivatedRestoreScroll /
 *   onDeactivatedResetScroll (its own KeepAlive hooks).

  //   • Declarative, not an imperative inline style: the style is part of
  //     the render, so a container remount (stream completion re-keys the
  //     turn) re-renders WITH the reserve — a reserve-less frame (and the
  //     scrollTop clamp it caused: view silently shoved up, fake jump
  //     arrow) cannot be produced. The imperative design needed a restore
  //     helper plus a remount watcher to approximate this, and still lost
  //     the race whenever anything forced layout mid-remount.
  //   • Keyed by the turn's opening message id, NOT by position: positional
  //     bindings re-map onto different containers the instant the turn
  //     count changes mid-send (optimistic append lands several microtasks
  //     after pinAfterSend). Id keying is inert to turn-count changes; it
  //     relies on render ids being stable across the optimistic → server
  //     consolidation, which the store guarantees (adoptRenderIdentity).

  // reserve. Do not reuse for Thought/tool expands, stream completion,
  // remounts, or prepend — those stay browser-owned (overflow-anchor) or
  // follow/escape owned.
  //
  // Why we write scrollTop at all (vs "let the browser handle shrink"):
  //   Residual pin blank is product geometry, not content. Clearing
  //   min-height is a deliberate layout edit on the send handover. The
  //   browser's clamp / scroll anchoring do not know we want "parked on
  //   previous-turn content → keep that content still; blank below may
  //   vanish". Left alone, clamp/anchoring and a later tween fight; the

  //
  // Geometry (residual blank always at the BOTTOM of its turn container,

  //
  //   before clear:  container height = max(content, minHeight)

  //   delta         = before − after  (≥ 0; the blank we remove)

  //   removed band  = [collapseTop, collapseTop + delta)
  //
  // Position-aware scrollTop (only when delta > 0):
  //
  //   • scrollTop ≤ collapseTop
  //       Viewport top is above the blank (reading previous-turn content,
  //       or history further up). Leave scrollTop alone. The blank below
  //       the user vanishes; what they were looking at stays put. This is
  //       the common "send while still parked on the previous pin" path
  //       and "scroll up into history then send".
  //
  //   • scrollTop > collapseTop
  //       Viewport top sits inside or past the blank. Subtract only the
  //       removed length that was above the viewport top:
  //         scrollTop -= min(delta, scrollTop − collapseTop)
  //       so content that lived BELOW the blank does not jump.
  //
  // Rejected formulas (do not bring back):
  //   • scrollTop -= delta always
  //       Anchors content below the blank. Yanks history readers toward
  //       the top; shifts a parked pin's visible content before the
  //       entrance tween — "spacing snaps off, whole view jumps, then
  //       the down animation starts".
  //   • defer clear until tween settle (+ prompt-as-anchor restore)
  //       Flight runs with [prev | EMPTY | new prompt]. Tween scrolls
  //       through the empty band; previous turn looks unmounted until
  //       settle removes spacing and it reappears.
  //   • prompt-as-anchor compensation on the PRE-tween clear
  //       Keeps the NEW prompt fixed; when the user is still looking at
