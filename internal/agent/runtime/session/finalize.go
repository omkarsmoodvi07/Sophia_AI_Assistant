// finalizeLedgerRun records the run's terminal state durably, fenced by the
// token its owner holds.
//
// It runs before the live release, and that order is the same one the reaper
// uses for the same reason: the live lease is the only pointer a reaper has to
// an unfinished run, so releasing it before the durable write would strand a row
// that says `running` with nothing left to notice. Failing this write therefore
// means the caller must leave the lease alone and let it expire — the reaper
// then transitions the run to `lost`, which is wrong about how the turn ended but
// safe about the session's active slot.
//
// A zero fencing token means the run was started through a pre-ledger entry
// point and has no durable row to transition, not that fencing was skipped.
