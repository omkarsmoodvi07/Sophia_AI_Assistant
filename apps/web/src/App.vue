    <!-- Single RouterView (v-slot) drives both the settings section and the
         auth-boundary pages. On chat routes the matched component is a null stub,
         so `Component` renders nothing. -->
    <RouterView v-slot="{ Component }">
      <!-- Settings section: a permanent fixed full-screen positioning layer
           (always in the DOM + compositor layer tree), toggled with `visibility`
           only — never v-if, never opacity. Why each matters:
           (1) v-if'ing the layer tore down a promoted compositor layer in one
               frame → Chromium recomposited chat underneath with a gap (flash).
           (2) The wrapper is TRANSPARENT (no bg). settings-section paints its own
               opaque bg-background, so while it slides/fades in or out the layer
               behind it is the live chat — never a black backdrop. Earlier the
               wrapper itself was near-black, so any fade/leave revealed a dark
               wash. Transparent + visibility flip = clean, no flash, no fade.
           z-(--z-overlay), not --z-panel: this was bare z-40 pre-ladder (no
           dedicated tier — the ladder's z-40 slot folds into overlay or panel
           by use, see packages/ui/AGENTS.md "z 梯"). MainSection stays mounted
           BEHIND this layer while settings is open, and its chat-pane composer/
           slash-panel floats already sit at --z-panel (30) — tying this wrapper
           to the same 30 would make "settings always wins" depend on DOM order
           instead of an explicit rank, which is exactly the hidden-dependency
           risk the ladder migration is supposed to remove. --z-overlay (50)
           preserves the original strict 40-over-30 inequality. -->
