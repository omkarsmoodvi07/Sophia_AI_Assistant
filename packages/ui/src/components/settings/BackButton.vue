  <!-- THE back affordance for in-page detail surfaces (DetailPane and the
       bot-detail tabs that can't use DetailPane). One component so the
       geometry below is tuned in exactly one place — this used to be
       copy-pasted into every caller and drifted.

       The button surface shares the detail body's left rail, so its hover /
       pressed fill aligns with the card edge below instead of hanging into
       the outer gutter. px-4 keeps the chevron and label comfortably inset. -->
