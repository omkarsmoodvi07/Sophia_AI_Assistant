// Package ledger is the durable half of the session runtime: the record of
// which runs were admitted, who owns them, and how they ended.
//
// It deliberately holds no liveness. The owner lease lives only in the live
// backend, so PostgreSQL receives exactly four kinds of write — admission,
// ownership/fencing change, decision, terminal transition. Nothing here is a
// heartbeat or a progress sample, which is why write volume is proportional to
// the number of runs rather than to their duration or token rate. A reader
// therefore cannot ask this store "is the owner still alive"; only the live
// backend can answer that, and the reaper is built around that fact.
