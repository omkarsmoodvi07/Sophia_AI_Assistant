// Package payload defines the on-wire shapes for agent-emitted events
// published to the chat event hub. Producers build their payloads through
// these helpers so the contract is exercised by one set of tests instead of
// being duplicated as map literals across packages.
//
// Any field added to the returned maps lands on the wire. The top-level
// `session_id` placement is load-bearing: a consumer routes an event to a
// session by reading that key directly, without unwrapping nested objects.
